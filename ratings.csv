8750807450,Not a good app,"I‚Äôm baffled how this app has a star rating of 4.8. It‚Äôs just incredibly slow. Click on the ‚ÄúChat‚Äù button at the bottom and nothing happens; Click on the ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù button and it says ‚Äúnothing scheduled‚Äù, and then maybe, sometimes, the actual team schedule will pop up. For the record I have a new iPhone 13 Pro and a fast data connection via fiber network, so it‚Äôs not the equipment being used. I‚Äôve learned the tricks for navigating it to make the Chat/Schedule display, but it‚Äôs a really buggy app, very slow to display info, and just not a good user experience. Many of the parents on our team complain of the same thing. There are much, much, better alternatives available for managing/communicating with your team, and I‚Äôm going to talk with our organization‚Äôs director to see if we can try something different.

The chat notification number is always wrong. WhatsApp just has a better experience when users are both iOS and Android. Don‚Äôt upload your photos - parents can‚Äôt download them. The soccer team that my older son was on pays $100 a year to use TeamSnap even though they get SportsEngine for free. I also see the developer responding to all the other reported bugs asking for people to reach out to support. This irritates me - we are your customers, not your QA department.

Chat notifications (banner, Lock Screen, bubbles, etc) work intermittently at best. Right now I cannot get 2 of my teams to show up under the chat section. But when I go to the team directly and then to chat from within the team page, I can see the chats. Lately more and more users complain that they get logged out several times a day and have to log in again. Yet if a notification happens to work it still has them logged in. It seems to be getting worse over time as I get more and more negative feedback and even request to use other apps. It‚Äôs a shame as the design and integration are actually really nice when it works. It has gotten so bad this year that our manager is trying to contact support to see what we can do. Our travel team often has last minute updates to schedules and locations and they are often missed. This creates stress for families and players and takes away from the overall experience they are meant to have in these sports programs.

One major feature that has been omitted is live scoring, which is proving even more important as we now have restrictions as to the number of people that can attend the game and they are asking for this feature to follow the team when they cannot attend.

5628473292,Absolutely terrible,"Our soccer club started using this app this year. It‚Äôs absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs clear that the people developing it have no idea how teams use it. It‚Äôs location feature is a mess. I end up putting game locations in other spots so our parents can find the location address and not default to the location website and have to find it there. When i want to make a simple change to game info (uniform, add field number, etc.), even though I click to not notify the team, it does so immediately. This causes way too many unimportant messages to be sent. There are unnecessary privacy features that make it difficult to get contact info for teammates. This app/program is just a mess. We have a tournament this weekend and i have no faith in my ability to get the app to do what I need it to do. I am going to personally pay for my team to use TeamSnap again because I dislike this app so much. I will encourage our club to move back to TS next year.

It‚Äôs aweful after using team snap who has this dialed in - it‚Äôs like going back to the Stone Age. So basic it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have any attention to detail. For instance if I list arrive time an hour earlier it doesn‚Äôt show that anywhere on your linked calendar or in the app unless you drill down into the notes. The game scoring is awful- that‚Äôs all you can do is keep basic score. You can‚Äôt keep time, you can‚Äôt put which half it is or half time.

2730852393,Hasn‚Äôt worked properly since I downloaded it two days ago,I run a large sports organization of roughly 40 teams year round. I need quick access to communication for all teams on my phone. This app is a huge disappointment so far and will most likely require that I use a third party app. The roster only loads once every ten attempts or so. Customer service people have been very nice but the product itself is the problem.,0,1,1,2018-06-20T04:17:44-07:00,5.11.2
2726444613,Absolutely HORRENDOUS!,"This app is possibly the worst app in history. Rosters/proofs of birth won‚Äôt upload. It‚Äôs lost all my information twice and portions of my information several times, thus costing me HOURS of lost productivity. I FINALLY got it to upload 2-4 files at a time, then had to click the ‚Äúback‚Äù button, then refresh, then add more. I cannot access MY team‚Äôs roster/information on the website, and I cannot even LOCATE my teams using the search engine on the app. Worthless, worthless, WORTHLESS!",0,1,1,2018-06-19T11:38:50-07:00,5.11.2

2651050923,Awful,"The app itself is mostly fine. It‚Äôs the back-end service and team management dashboard that just don‚Äôt work. I manage SE for our team within a club of teams. Half the parents on the team (typically those who were in SportsEngine last year) aren‚Äôt getting invite emails to join the team in SE. Some are finding their invitations if they log into the SE website, but most don‚Äôt since they use this app. Then there‚Äôs the issue of inviting guardians. As the SE manager for the team, I‚Äôm not allowed to do this. Only the initial parent I invite can invite others. What a train wreck that feature is. Some parents report back to me that they get ‚Äúaccess denied‚Äù when trying to accept the invitation. I have nothing to offer them about how to fix that. Sometimes the app is just out of sync. Force quitting and restarting seems to help. Or reinstalling.",0,1,1,2018-06-06T08:06:29-07:00,5.11.2
